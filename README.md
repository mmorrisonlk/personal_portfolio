So my original "brilliant" idea was to base this on a JRPG menu interface. Which is why I went for a paper color for the background and found a creative commons ancient map (JRPGs often have a worldmap on the menu screen). With that in mind I wanted to try and get my portrait to line up with the links so it would call back to an RPG stat block. A bit of a reach I recognize. 

I started by plotting out my initial divs that I would need. I reasoned that I would need 1 for my picture, 3 required topic links, and the 3 sections. I built those and added placeholder text so I could try and get the sizing the way I envisioned it. I went about defining flex box properties such that they would organize themselves correctly regardless of website size. It is responsive but not as responsive as I would like it to be. Which I think is the feeling I would apply to most of the project. Like it works but I'm not happy with the look but I don't want to start over right now. I will plan on going back and redoing this later on.

One thing I am particularly proud of is the organization of the css file. I think it looks clean with repeated classes where I want to apply the same formatting. I might have gone a bit overboard with classes for the amount of things on the site but I think its a good long term solution that allows it to scale well with new elements and making replacements easy to find.
